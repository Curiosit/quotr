# quotr

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) quote sharing app bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
The app involves MongoDB integration, logging with NextAuth using Google Provider, and simple search and profile functions in Javascript.

After logging in with NextAuth using Google Provider, the user can add new quotes.

Users can also see their own profile page and modify already posted quotes.

The code is based on [tutorial](https://github.com/adrianhajdin/project_next_13_ai_prompt_sharing
), although visually and thematically modified.
