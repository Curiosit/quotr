# quotr

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) quote sharing app bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
The app involves MongoDB integration, logging with NextAuth using Google Provider, and simple search and profile functions in Javascript.
